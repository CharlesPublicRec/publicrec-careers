		Public Rec is building a digitally native leisure brand on a mission to make comfort look good.
		We’re growing rapidly and looking for someone to join the Marketing team. Chicago preferred, but
		open to remote for the right person.
		<br />
		<br />
		We’re seeking an experienced Influencer and Partnerships Manager to join our marketing team.
		Reporting to our Head of Marketing, this role will be key in building out our influencer and
		brand ambassador programs from the ground floor. The right candidate will already have
		pre-existing relationships with influencers in the fashion/apparel/retail space and will help
		identify new partnerships and areas of focus.
		<br />
		<br />
		As the Influencer Manager, you will own the execution of major influencer and brand ambassador
		campaigns including sourcing, negotiating terms and usage rights, sending product, and working
		with Creative on getting assets approved from the Influencers and ambassadors. Ability to run
		whitelisted paid social ads is a plus.
		<br />
		<br />
		We are committed to building a diverse and inclusive environment at Public Rec. Please submit
		resumes to careers@publicrec.com.
